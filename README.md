# COVID-Humidity-Mobility-GAM
Generalized Additive Model assessing effects of absolute humidity and human encounters on COVID-19 transmission in the United States.

## Overview
This repository contains the code to **Investigating the effects of absolute humidity and human encounters on transmission of COVID-19 in the United States**.

## Running the dynamic time-warping clustering analysis
To conduct partitional clustering using dynamic time warping, just run the R script named `RunDTWCluster.R` file in R. The seeding used in the Lin et al. (2020) is included in the R script.

## Running the GAM Analysis
To conduct the GAM Analysis in main article and supplement, run the `RunGAMAnalysis.R` script.

## Running the correlation analysis
To generate the corerelation matrix in the supplement, execute the `RunCorrelationAnalysis.R` script.

## Generating figures
To generate the figures, run `RunDataVisualization.R` script.
